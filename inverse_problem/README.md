# Milne-Eddington (M-E) inversion codes for the radiative transfer equation

In the general case, the complexity of the RTE makes it impossible to solve the inverse problem analytically, that is, to obtain the solar atmosphere parameters from the observed Stokes profiles. 

Certain simplifications and approximations are often used to solve the RTE, for instance, the Milne-Eddington (ME) model of the atmosphere. 
The model assumes a local thermal equilibrium and independence of the atmosphere parameters with height.
